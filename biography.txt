My name is Hyungjoo Han

I was born in South Korea but moved to Maryland when I was 5 years old.
I originally pursued flute/music performance, but changed my career path to statistics at UCLA.
I will hopefully graduate with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science in 2025.

My future goal is to be a data scientist.
